# Protoip (IP prototyping in FPGA hardware)

**Protoip** is a utility for quickly prototyping C-based IP in FPGA hardware:
abstracting many specific low level FPGA design details, **protoip** shifts the main focus to IP (algorithm) coding (C/C++ programming language), and boosts productivity.

**Protoip** provides Tcl-based functions accessible by both Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and Matlab, custom templates, examples and tutorials to support all design phases.

**Protoip** is an application that comes together with XILINX.
